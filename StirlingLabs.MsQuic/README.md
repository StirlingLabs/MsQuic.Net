### Cross-platform implementation of the IETF QUIC protocol

Based on the high-performance [MsQuic](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic) project from 
Microsoft, exposed to C# with a strong cross-platform focus.

## üëÄ What's included

MsQuic.Net solves our requirements for cross-platform datagrams and Quic access, using 
portable certificates (i.e. [QuicTLS/OpenSSL](https://github.com/quictls/openssl)) and 
our [portable sockets](hhttps://github.com/StirlingLabs/sockaddr.Net) implementation.

## üê£ Lifecycle

Versions follow our internal [numbering](https://github.com/StirlingLabs/Version.Net) system and the intent is for our latest release to 
support the current [MsQuic](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic) release.  See [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/StirlingLabs/MsQuic.Net) 
for more details.
