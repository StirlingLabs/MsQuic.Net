### .Net wrapper for MsQuic

## 🚀 How to install

If you've [configured GitHub Packages](/StirlingLabs/Logging/blob/master/docs/GitHubPackages.md), you can just:

```bash
> dotnet add PROJECT package MsQuic.Net
```

or just use NuGet however you would normally.

## 👀 What's included

Wrapper around [MsQuic](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic) solving our requirements for cross-platform datagrams and Quic access, 
using portable certificates (i.e. [QuicTLS/OpenSSL](https://github.com/quictls/openssl)).

## 🐣 Lifecycle

Versions follow our numbering system and the intent is to support the current MsQuic release.

Developed by [Stirling Labs](https://stirlinglabs.github.io).
